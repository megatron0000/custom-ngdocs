# custom-ngdocs
Modified version of m7r's [grunt-ngdocs](https://github.com/m7r/grunt-ngdocs)

I modified some things (and plan to modify more) and added documentation to the internal workings of it
(using the grunt-task this repo itself serves, for the angular part, and creating Typescript declaration files - published as HTML with Typedoc - for the NODEJS part).

A working example can be seen at [gi project](https://github.com/megatron0000/gi/), which is a website project (can be downloaded and served locally with npm http-serve package, for example). Beware: That project has comments in Portuguese !
